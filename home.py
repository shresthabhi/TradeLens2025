            Advanced investment tools—such as fundamental screeners, sentiment analytics, and strategy backtesting—are often spread across multiple platforms, making the analysis process time-consuming and fragmented.

⚠️ **Important Notice**  
This app makes live API calls to a financial data library. Since it's hosted on Streamlit Cloud, these calls may occasionally **fail due to rate limits or API restrictions**.

Additionally, FinBERT sentiment analysis **won't work on Streamlit Cloud** because it requires the `torch` library, which is difficult to install in this environment.

👉 To run this app with full functionality, including sentiment analysis, **please follow the setup instructions in the [README](https://github.com/sanjalD/TradeLens/tree/main) and host it locally.**
